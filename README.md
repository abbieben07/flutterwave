# NativeScript Community Plugin Seed

This is a repo for the NativeScript Community plugin seed. Its goal is to standardize and streamline the plugin development of Community plugins. This is an alternative to NativeScript's monorepo plugin seed. This plugin seed contains demos (Angular, Vue, Svelte, and React), Detox E2E testing, documentation generation, release management w/ Lerna, and standardized formatting/linting.
